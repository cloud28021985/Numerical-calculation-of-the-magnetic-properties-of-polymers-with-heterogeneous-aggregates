# Numerical-calculation-of-the-magnetic-properties-of-polymers-with-heterogeneous-aggregates

The program is the implementation of theoretical modeling of the static magnetization of a dimer consisting of two immobile single-domain ferromagnetic particles. The program is intended for the numerical solution of integrals of high multiplicity. This program can be useful for scientific calculations in the field of magnetic phenomena. For parallel calculations, the Message Passing Interface is used. When the program is launched, the orientation of the dimer magnetic moment is calculated for various physical parameters and the results are written to text files. Visualization of the obtained results is performed by reading data from text files with their subsequent graphic processing. To obtain graphic images, the Python programming language is used with the connection of the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
